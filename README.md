# Star Classification Neural Network

This project creates and trains a neural network model to classify stars by star types based on information passed into it by a NASA star classification database.

To run the neural network and save the neural network to your own local repository once trained, you will need to have all the prerequisites installed, and run this command from within the repository:

```
python3 star-class.py
```
